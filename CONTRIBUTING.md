## One Profile Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for wanting to contribute! We appreciate you taking the time to work on this project with us. 

### Some things to keep in mind:
- Check the roadmap to see if what you're thinking is already there and if anyone is working on it
- For bugs, it's helpful if you can include some steps to reproduce the bug and basic info about the OS and machine
- We use Golang, so make sure to run `go fmt` on your changes before submitting a CR
